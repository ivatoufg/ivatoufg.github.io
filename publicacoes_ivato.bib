  Abstract                 = {Analyzing and improving large urban traffic networks is a difficult process due to complex interrelationships between the many variables that impact vehicle traffic behavior. Information visualization techniques can facilitate the tasks of analyzing large amounts of data and of exploring potential solutions to practical traffic problems. Surprisingly, there is a relative lack of investigation focused on how information visualization techniques should be applied and adapted to the field of Traffic Engineering. This paper presents an overview of what has been done on this topic by reviewing the use of information visualization in traffic systems over the years, and highlighting the current state-of-the-art by focusing on several innovative pieces of research. We provide a classification of the reviewed work and identify areas that have been understudied.},

  abstract  = {Smartwatches are gaining popularity on market with a set of features comparable to smartphones in a wearable device. This novice technology brings new interaction paradigms and challenges for blind users, who have difficulties dealing with touchscreens. Among a variety of tasks that must be studied, text entry is analyzed, considering that current existing solutions may be unsatisfactory (as voice input) or even unfeasible (as working with tiny QWERTY keyboards) for a blind user. More specifically, this paper presents a study on possible solutions for composing a Braille cell on smart-watches. Five prototypes were developed and different feedback features were proposed. These are confronted with seven specialists on an evaluation study that results in a qualitative analysis of which strategies can be more useful for blind users in a Braille text entry.},

  abstract  = {Scheduling is a very important problem in many organizations, such as hospitals, transportation companies, sports confederations and educational institutions. Obtaining a good schedule results in the maximization of some desired benefit. In particular, in educational institutions (from elementary school to universities) this problem is periodically experienced, either during the preparation of class-teacher or examination timetabling. When a solution proposal is being elaborated (manual, semi-automatic or automatic processes), it is common the occurrence of the phenomenon called conflict, clash or collision. It is characterized by the simultaneous use of a resource (human or material) that can not be shared and, therefore, its occurrence makes that proposal impracticable for adoption. In semi-automatic systems, it is common the identification of such problems and, through user interaction, its resolution. Automatic systems, on the other hand, try to identify/solve conflicts without user intervention. Despite this, conflicts are not easy to resolve. This article proposes the use of information visualization techniques as an approach to highlight the occurrence of conflicts and, using user hints, contribute to its resolution, aiming at obtaining better quality timetables for practical adoption. The proposed visualizations were evaluated in order to determine its expressiveness and effectiveness, considering four aspects: coverage of the research questions, efficiency of the adopted visual mapping, supported level of human interaction and scalability. A conceptual qualitative study showed that the use of these techniques can aim users, mainly non-specialized, to identify conflicts and improve the desired educational timetables.},

  abstract  = {Urban traffic simulators are valuable tools for prior and low-cost evaluation of modification proposals for road networks, aimed at improving vehicular mobility. The system covered in this article, called PetGyn, falls into this category. It is powerful enough to represent scenarios of changes in the structure of road networks and/or in the behavior of their elements (pathways, traffic lights, possible conversions, etc.) and for predicting road usage levels (volume and traffic speed). In addition, PetGyn's flexibility allows the employment of different traffic allocation models (system optimization, user equilibrium, etc.), various types of cost functions (from the classic BPR - Bureau of Public Roads - arc cost functions to non-separable and asymmetric functions) and the simulation of different behaviors for the road network components (blocking routes according to schedules/days, reversing the direction of traffic flows, allowing/forbidden parking along the lanes, among others). Since its conception, it was built in a modular way so that it can be easily adapted to the urban traffic particularities of any country. Unlike commercial systems in this area, PetGyn was developed under a free software philosophy and as a web-based system in order to favor collaborative work. Its usage allows the study of intervention projects for medium-sized metropolitan regions, contributing to identify possible improvements in urban mobility.},

  abstract            = {Urban mobility has become one of the main problems faced by large cities. The increasing amount of vehicles combined with limited road infrastructure result in traffic congestion and in several other traffic-related issues such as fuel wastage, time losses, health problems and environmental pollution. As an attempt to mitigate these problems, much research has been done and tools developed for the study and improvement of urban traffic conditions. However, visualizing Origin-Destination (OD) matrices, an important element of urban traffic studies, is still a challenge. In general, showing OD matrices in an effective way involves considering georeferenced temporal aspects, traffic multimodality and large volumes of data; factors that have not been fully addressed by the existing approaches. This paper proposes a new visual representation for OD matrices that deals with these factors, filling a gap in this area.},

A novel evolutionary edge bundling algorithm for these problems is described. The algorithm was successfully tested by solving two related problems applied to real-world instances in reasonable computational time. The development and analysis of optimization models have received little attention in the area of edge bundling. However, the reported experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed evolutionary algorithm to help resolve edge bundling problems formally defined as optimization models.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have evaluated the work done by software developers using data extracted from version control systems (VCS). However, they have focused mostly on counting the amount of written lines of code and the number of commits, which are general information that can be obtained from these software repositories. In the present article, we innovate by considering fine-grain operations at line and file levels stored in the VCS, like additions, deletions and modifications, which allow to derive a much more detailed and rich information about the work done by developers. We also define a new set of metrics to measure such fine-grain information and present two simple approaches for comparing developers based on the proposed metrics. This helps to improve our understanding of how important and alike the developers were. A case study using data from a real software development project is described. The study showed that the metrics and the comparative approaches resulted in information that is consistent with the perception of the project manager. Furthermore, our investigation points to a great potential for future work by expanding the set of metrics and exploring new comparative approaches.},

The present paper is a literature review that identifies the state- of-the-art in applying machine learning techniques to problems in graph drawing. We focused on machine learning strategies that build up and represent knowledge about how to draw a graph. Surprisingly, only a few pieces of research can be found about this subject. We classified them in two main groups: the ones that extract knowledge from the user by human-computer interaction and those that are not based on data directly gathered from users. The study of these methods shows that there is still much to research and to develop regarding the application of machine learning to graph drawing. We suggest directions for future research on this area.},

It was efficiently implemented on a machine with a many-core GPU, which is less expensive than a cluster of computers. The tests were performed on a Tesla C2075 graphics card. The implementation was able to identify the shortest paths among all pairs of vertices of randomly generated graphs (all containing a maximum of 8192 vertices) in less than 15 seconds, which represents a speedup of 150x over the sequential Floyd-Warshall algorithm.},

  abstract     = {$C^3$ (pronounced C-cubic) is a tangible interface under development by researchers at Media Lab -- UFG, for multi-user interaction. The interface consists of three large, but light cubes that can be lifted, rotated and moved in a room by a group of people. Each cube detects its orientation (which side is positioned on the top) and the proximity to the other cubes. For simplicity, proximity between any pair of cubes was defined only as near (up to 2 meters) and far (above 2 meters). This set of three cubes allows $6^3$ combinations of upside positioning. Considering only proximity, 5 different setups are possible (no cube near the others, all three cubes nearby, and three pairwise proximity combinations). In total, the setup offers $6^3$ x 5 = 1,080 combinations. Each one of them can be assigned to a different output involving blinking of lights and sound feedback. The sides of the cubes can be painted with pictures. The interface was thought as a way of transmitting new concepts to the users, for instance, in an educational environment. Motivational activities and pure entertainment are also possible applications for $C^3$. These goals can be reached by assigning the above mentioned combinations to specific feedbacks. The intensity of the feedbacks can be designed to guide the users to one or more targeting configurations, in which the images of the three cubes, when visualized together, compose a new concept. For the current exhibition, $C^3$ is programmed to highlight a poetic perspective in a ludic way. The ludic aspect acts as a motivational element and the poetic perspective is defined by the combinatorial setups of the cubes. High peaks in the behavior of the system, triggered by the user by a series of actions, are composed of sounds and kaleidoscopic lights for some preconfigured combinations.},

  abstract      = {This paper discusses three edge bundling optimization problems that aim to minimize the total number of bundles of a graph drawing, in conjunction with other aspects, as the main goal. A novel evolutionary algorithm for edge bundling for these problems is described. The algorithm was successfully tested by solving the related problems applied to real-world instances in reasonable computational time. The development and analysis of optimization models have received little attention in the area of edge bundling. However, the reported experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed evolutionary algorithm to help resolve edge bundling problems by formally defining them as optimization models.},

  abstract  = {The analysis of affinity or similarity between people is an important task in the study of social dynamics. Traditional methods for determining similarity depends on considerable amount of data regarding people's preferences and features. Those methods present limitations when the data is scarce and/or changes constantly. This paper introduces a new method for determining people similarity that does not suffer from the same problems. The method can learn a customized similarity function based on social variables of friends that attend the same events (concerts, parties, conferences etc), collected from social networks. Two types of optimization algorithms for learning a similarity function are presented: The universal function approximator modelling, which relays on the relationship of social attributes and a friends' importance ranking; and the populational evolutionary modelling, which linearly combines social variables. Both models were tested in a generalist and in a specialist approach. The results show that the specialist approach exceeded in almost 38 % the generalist approach using populational evolutionary methods and in almost 69 % when using the universal function approximator methods. Among the implemented optimization algorithms employed inside the methods for learning similarity, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization presented better performance for the populational evolutionary methods and the Artificial Neural Network presented the best performance overall using the universal function approximator modelling.},

The experimentation was carried out with one real instance of the problem coming from a Brazilian school dedicated to elementary education and, in addition, with instances from widely known datasets. It turns out that the methods are able to produce solutions suitable for practical use in their contexts, being that method In Vitro has overcome the others for the established optimization goal.},

Given the nature of the problem and some difficult challenges to be dealt with, an Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) approach was devised. Furthermore, it was necessary to adopt a surrogate function method for approximating the user's preferences and to implement a Web-based virtual simulation environment for speeding up the generation and the evaluation of \emph{$C^3$ Cubes} projects. The integration of all these elements is crucial for producing new user-guided cube projects with interesting behaviors. The main approaches experimented in this research and the proposed design solutions are useful to solving similar problems in other domain areas, for example, in the context of game design.},

In this SRL we considered publications from the last twenty years (1998‚Äì2018) indexed by seven solid scientific databases. The review clearly identified that there is a small amount of studies devoted to the intersection between IV and Ed-TTP in that period.

Entre as ferramentas que t√™m sido propostas para esse fim, destacam-se alguns sistemas computacionais que foram melhorados significativamente nos √∫ltimos anos e que s√£o hoje de uso frequente em empresas de engenharia de transportes e em setores p√∫blicos respons√°veis pelo gerenciamento do tr√¢nsito nas cidades, como o TransCAD, o VISUM/VISSIM e o SUMO. Cada um desses sistemas, no entanto, adota suas pr√≥prias formas de entrada de dados e de apresenta√ß√£o das informa√ß√µes relacionadas √† malha vi√°ria e √† simula√ß√£o do tr√°fego. O presente trabalho tem por objetivo avaliar os mecanismos interativos de modelagem e de simula√ß√£o do tr√°fego urbano presentes nos sistemas computacionais de modelagem e simula√ß√£o do tr√¢nsito mais populares, como aqueles supracitados, no intuito de identificar formas de intera√ß√£o e de visualiza√ß√£o que sejam eficazes e eficientes e ajudar no desenvolvimento de novos sistemas nessa √°rea. A metodologia utilizada na pesquisa consiste na an√°lise e na compara√ß√£o das interfaces gr√°ficas de tais sistemas, focando em algumas atividades interativas como cadastrar e editar malhas vi√°rias, convers√µes permitidas/proibidas, tempos de sem√°foro e matrizes OD, e apresentar e permitir explorar dados de fluxos de ve√≠culo simulados. Os mecanismos interativos adotados pelas interfaces est√£o sendo comparados quanto ao esfor√ßo f√≠sico demandado para utiliz√°-los (como, por exemplo, a quantidade exigida de clicks e de movimentos de mouse), o esfor√ßo cognitivo necess√°rio para o aprendizado de uso das interfaces e o n√≠vel de preserva√ß√£o do mapa mental do usu√°rio durante a execu√ß√£o das opera√ß√µes interativas. Um quadro comparativo das diversas formas de intera√ß√£o e de visualiza√ß√£o adotadas pelos principais sistemas ser√° apresentado.

  abstract  = {Recommender Systems are expert systems that utilize the user's interests in order to recommend different products. One of the main techniques employed in this type of system is the Collaborative Filtering which recommends products to users based on their interactions and on what items similar users have liked in the past. However, many traditional methods for determining similarity do not consider temporal information neither the rich information that is contained in sequentially-ordered user interactions. Therefore, the present work proposes the usage of traditional string comparison approaches for defining new similarity measures between pairs of users that take into consideration time-ordered data. The general idea is to model the similarity computation between users as an approximate string matching problem and to employ classical algorithms that solve it. Experiments conducted in different application domains demonstrate that the measures based on a string-comparison approach can improve accuracy. Furthermore, they represent a new way of evaluating the performance of sequence-based recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Word segmentation can contribute to improve the results of natural language processing tasks on several problem domains, including social media sentiment analysis, source code summarization and neural machine translation. Taking the English language as a case study, we fine-tune a Transformer architecture which has been trained through the Pre-trained Distillation (PD) algorithm, while comparing it to previous experiments with recurrent neural networks. We organize datasets and resources from multiple application domains under a unified format, and demonstrate that our proposed architecture has competitive performance and superior cross-domain generalization in comparison with previous approaches for word segmentation in Western languages.},

  abstract     = {The Brazilian Digital Library of Thesis and Dissertations (BDTD) provides essential data to support many social sciences investigations. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of computation tools tailored for helping extract and analyze the necessary information from the BDTD library. In this paper, we discuss the development of computational solutions to answer questions from a particular social sciences research using metadata from BDTD. The solutions involve the integration of data processing and presentation techniques, such as string-processing algorithms, knowledge graphs and information visualizations. All programming codes implemented at the scope of the project are available for helping other researchers. The paper also highlights the importance of having researchers from Social Science and Computer Science working together, what motivates future collaborations in these areas.},

The research involved a design science research methodology, guided by the real demands of a legal text processing company. The architecture, several design decisions and the current development stage of the software are presented. Preliminary user experiments for evaluating interactive document labeling are described. As a result, the first version of a system with an architecture composed of a mobile frontend that communicates with a backend through a REST API was published, with satisfactory performance evaluation by the applicant. Other results involve the use of active learning techniques to reduce human effort when performing the classification of documents, as well as the Uncertainty strategy to choose the document to be labeled. The effectiveness of the stop criterion for the active learning technique based on confidence level was tested and proved unsatisfactory, remaining as a future work.},
